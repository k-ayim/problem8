# Problem 8

This Java program checks whether a given string consists only of digits using recursion.

## Instructions

1. **Compilation:**
   - Compile the `Problem8DigitCheckRecursive.java` file using a Java compiler.

2. **Execution:**
   - Run the compiled program.
   - Enter the string when prompted.

3. **Output:**
   - The program will output whether the string consists only of digits or contains non-digit characters.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the `isAllDigits` method is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the method makes n recursive calls, checking each character of the string.
